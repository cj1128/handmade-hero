## Intro

- This is my personal study notes of [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org).
- If you think **writing a professional-quality game from scratch on your own (no engine no library)** is interesting and challenging, I highly recommend this project. In my opinion, it's the best I can find.
- Deepest thanks to *Casey Muratori* for this excellent project, it's really helpful.
