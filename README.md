## Intro

This is my personal study notes of the awesome project [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org).

If you think __writing a professional-quality game from scratch on your own (no engine no library)__ is interesting and challenging, I highly recommend this project.

In my opinion, it's **the best** I can find.

## Showcase

### Day 85

![](./day85.gif)

- We can jump üòâ
- We can shoot üî´
- We can go upstair and downstair üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
- We have a big world and many rooms üó∫
- We have a basic procedure generated ground üåø

## Env

Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2019 community version and Sublime Text 3.

Build system for Sublime Text 3:

```json
{
  "build_systems":
  [
    {
      "name": "HandmadeHero",
      "shell_cmd": "build",
      "file_regex":"^(.+?)\\((\\d+\\))(): (error)(.+)$"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setup

NOTE: **This repo does not contain copyrighted HandmadeHero assets, to build this repo, please consider preorder HandmadeHero**.

- Create a `w` drive using subst: `subst w: /c/whatever_directory_you_choose`
- Clone this repo into the root of `w`
- Install Visual Studio 2019 community version
- cd into `w` and init cl: `.\handmade-hero\misc\shell.bat`
- Build and enjoy! `build`

## Code Style

My preferred code style for C is different from Casey's.

- snake_case for types, e.g. `game_world`
- camelCase for variables, e.g. `globalRunning`
- PascalCase for functions and macro functions, e.g. `GameUpdateVideo`
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for macro constants, e.g. `TILES_PER_CHUNK`
- Prefix an underscore to indicate that this function should only be called with a corresponding macro, e.g. `_PushSize`

## Marks

- `NOTE`: Something we need to pay attention to
- `PLAN`: Something we plan to do it later
- `RESOURCE`: External valuable resource
- `DIFF`: Something I have done it differently from Casey
- `FUN`: Something interesting to know, like Windows can't correctly handle file formats they invented
- `CASEY`: Casey's opinion about programming

## Game Programming

- Every memory allocation should go through a macro, it will make the debugging much easier.
- `Premultiplied Alpha`: check day 83 for more details.
- `Gamma Correction`: check day 94 for more details.
- `Transform Normal`: check day 102 for more details.

## Windows Programming

### Command Prompt

- `dir /s [keyword]`: search files
- `findstr -s -n -i -l [keyword]`: find strings

### Win32 API

- `WS_EX_TOPMOST`: make window in front of others
- `WS_EX_LAYERED` and `SetLayeredWindowAttributes `: change window alpha

### Visual Studio

- `Spy++`: inspect windows and messages

## TODO

- Fix full screen problem caused by systeml-level display scale
- Fix long running freeze bug: let the game run for a while and it will freeze
- Slow speed when moving across rooms

## Roadmap

- `ReleaseDC`

### Day 4: Animating the Back Buffer

- Use `VirtualAlloc` to alloc bit map memory instead of `CreateDIBSection`
- `VirtualFree`, `VirtualProtect`
- Set `biHeight` to negative value so we the image origin if top-left
- Render a simple gradient. Each pixel has a value of form `0xXXRRGGBB`
- use `PeekMessage` instead of `GetMessage`, because it doesn't block
- `GetDC`, `ReleaseDC`

### Day 5: Windows Graphics Review

- `HREDRAW` and `VREDRAW` are used to tell Windows to redraw the whole window
- Use `win32_offscreen_buffer` to bundle all global variables

- `tSine`, `LatencySampleCount`
- We need to handle xinput deadzone in the future
- Use `DefWindowProcA` instead of `DefWindowProc`

### Day 10: QueryPerformanceCounter and RDTSC

- `QueryPerformanceCounter`, `LARGE_INTEGER`, `QuyerPerformanceFrequency`
- `wsprintf`, `__rdtsc`

### Day 11: The Basics of Platform API Design

- Win32 platform todo list:
  - Saved game location
  - Getting a handle to our executable
  - Asset loading
  - Threading
  - Raw input (support for multiple keyboards)
  - Sleep/timeBeginPeriod
  - ClipCursor() (for multimonitor)

  - WM_ACTIVATEAPP (for when we are not the active application)
  - Blit speed improvements
  - Hardware acceleration
  - GetKeyboardLayout (for French keyboards)
- For each platform, we will have a big [platform]\_handmade.cpp file. Inside this file, we #include other files.
- Treat our game as a service, rather than the operating system.

### Day 12: Platform-Independent Sound Output

- `_alloca`: Allocate some memory in the stack, freeed when the function exists rather than leave out of the enclosing scope
- Move sound rendering logic to handmade.cpp

### Day 13: Platform-Independent User Input

- Define `game_input`, `game_controller_input`, `game_button_state`
- Store OldInput and NewInput and do ping-pang at end of every frame
- Define `ArrayCount` macro

### Day 14: Platform-Independent Game Memory

- Use a `game_memory` struct to handle all memory related stuff
- We have permannent storage and trasient storage in our memory
- Define `Kilobytes`, `Megabytes` and `GigaBytes` macros
- We require the memory allocated to be cleared to zero
- Define `Assert` macro
- Use `cl -Dname=val` to define `HANDMADE_INTERNAL` and `HANDMADE_SLOW` compiler flags
- Specify base address when we do `VirtualAlloc` for debugging purpose in internal build

### Day 15: Platform-Independent Debug File

- Define `DebugPlatformReadFile`, `DebugPlatformWriteFile` and `DebugPlatformFreeFileMemory` only when we are using internal build
- Define `SafeTruncateUInt64` inline functions
- `CreateFile`, `GetFileSizeEx`, `ReadFile`
- `__FIEL__` is a compile time macro points to current file

### Day 16: Visual Studio Compiler Switches
- VS compiler switches:
  - `-WX`, `-W4`: enable warning level 4 and treat warnings as errors
  - `-wd`: turn off some warnings
  - `-MT`: static link C runtime library
  - `-Oi`: generates intrinsic functions.
  - `-Od`: disable optimization
  - `-GR-`: disable run-time type information, we don't need this
  - `-Gm-`: disable minimal rebuild
  - `-EHa-`: disable exception-handling
  - `-nologo`: don't print compiler info
  - `-FC`: full Path of Source Code File in Diagnostics
- Init `vsdevcmd` using `-arch=x86` flags to build a 32-bit version of our program
- Use `/link` to pass linker options to make a valid Windows XP executable
  - `-subsystem:windows,5.1`

### Day 17: Unified Keyboard and Gamepad Input

- Add one controller, so we have 5 controllers now
- Extract `CommonCompilerFlags` and `CommonLinkerFlags` in build.bat
- Copy old keyboard button state to new keyboard button state
- Add MoveUp, MoveDown, MoveLeft, MoveRight buttons
- Handle XInput dead zone
- Check whether union in game_controller_input is aligned

### Day 18: Enforcing a Video Frame Rate

- We need to find a way to reliably retrieve monitor refresh rate?
- We define `GameUpdateHz` based on `MonitorRefreshHz`
- Use `Sleep` to wait for the remaining time
- Use `timeBeginPeriod` to modify scheduler granularity

### Day 19: Improving Audio Synchronization

- Record last play cursor and write cursor
- Define `Win32DebugSyncPlay` to draw it
- Use a while loop to test direct sound audio update frequency

### Day 20: Debugging the Audio Sync

__The audio sync logic is indeed very hard and complicated__.

I didn't take many notes because I was really confused and I didn't understand much.

- Compute audio latency seconds using write cursor - play cursor
- Define `GameGetSoundSamples`

### Day 21: Loading Game Code Dynamically

- Compile win32_handmade and handmade separaely
- Define win32_game_code and
- Put platform debug functions to game memroy
- Enable `/LD` switch to build dll
- Use /EXPORT linker flags to export dll functions
- We don't need to define `DllMain` entry point in our dll
- extern "C" to prevent name mangling
- Turn off incremental link
- Use `CopyFile` to copy the dll

### Day 22: Instantaneous Live Code Editing

NOTE: `CopyFile` may fail the first time, We use a while loop to do it. This is debug code so We don't care the performance;

- Use /PDB:name linker options to specify pdb file name
- Add timestamp to output pdb file name
- Delete PDB files and pipe del output to NUL
- Use `FindFirstFile` to get file write time
- Use `CompareFileTime` to compare file time
- Use `GetModuleFileName` to get exe path and use it to build full dll path
- We can use MAX_PATH macro to define length of path buffer

### Day 23: Looped Live Code Editing

- Define `win32_state` to store InputRecordIndex and InputPlayingIndex, we only support one slot now
- Press L to toggle input recording
- Store input and memory into files
- Use a simple jump to test our looped editing
- We can use `WS_EX_TOPMOST` and `WS_EX_LAYERED` to make our window the top most one and has some opacity
- We can do it in `WM_ACTIVATEAPP` message so when the game loses focus it will be transparent

### Day 24: Win32 Platform Layer Cleanup

- Fix the audio bug (I have already fixed that in previous day)
- Change blit mode to 1-to-1 pixles
- Use `%random%` for pdb files
- Change compiler flag `MT` to `MTd`
- Store EXE directory in Win32State and put record input file to build dir
- Use `GetFileAttributeEx` instead of `FindFirstFile` to get last write time of a file

### Day 25: Finishing the Win32 Prototyping Layer

- Use `GetDeviceCaps` to get monitor refresh rate
- Pass `thread_context` from platform to game and from game to platform
- Add mouse info to game_input, using `GetCursorPos`, `ScreenToClient`
- Record mouse buttons using `GetKeyState`
- Define win32_replay_buffer and store game state memory in memory using `CopyMemory` (Storing in disk actually is very fast in my computer, but I am gonna do it anyway)
- I am not gonna do memory mapping, because I think it's unnecessary

### Day 26: Introduction to Game Architecture

Today there isn't any code to write. I am just listening to Casey talking about what a good game architecture looks like.

In Casey's view, game architect is like a __Urban Planner__. Their job are organizing things roughly instead of planning things carefully. I can't agree more.

### Day 27: Exploration-based Architecture

- Add `SecondsToAdvanceOverUpdate` to game_input
- Remove debug code
- Turn off warning C4505, it's annoying. We are gonna have unreferenced local functions.
- Target resolution: 960 x 540 x 30hz
- Define `DrawRectangle`

### Day 28: Drawing a Tilemap

- Use floating point to store colors, because it will make it a lot more eaiser when we have to do some math about colors
- Draw a simple tilemap
- Draw a simple player, keep in mind that player's moving should consider the time delta. Otherwise it will move fast if we run at a higher FPS.

### Day 29: Basic Tilemap Collision Checking

- Using `PatBlt` to clear screen when display our buffer
- We should only clear the four gutters otherwise there will be some flashing
- Implement a simple collision check
- Seperate the header file into handmade.h and handmade_platform.h

### Day 30: Moving Between Tilemaps

- Define four tilemaps, and notice that in C the two dimension array is Y first and X last
- Define `canonicol_position` and `raw_postion`
- Implement moving between tilemaps

### Day 31: Tilemap Coordinate Systems

- NOTE: Basically any CPU we are gonna target at has SSE2
- Define `handmade_intrinsic.h`
- Define `TileSizeInMeters` and `TileSizeInPixels`
- Optimization switches: `/O2 /Oi /fp:fast`
- PLAN: Pack tilemap index and tile index into a single 32-bit integer
- PLAN: Convert TileRelX and TileRelY to resolution independent world units
- RESOURCE: Intel Intrinsics Guide, https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/

### Day 32: Unified Position Representation

- Remove `raw_position`
- Add `canonical_postion PlayerPos` to game state
- Define `RecononicalizePosition`
- Use meters instead of pixels as units

### Day 33: Virtualized Tilemaps

- Rename `canonical_position` to `world_position`
- Make Y axis go upward
- RESOURCE: a great book about typology: *Galois' Dream: Group Theory and Differential Equations*
- Remove TileMapX and TileMapY
- Define `tile_map_position`
- 24-bit for tilemap and 8-bit for tiles
- Implement a simple scroll so the guy can move

### Day 34: Tilemap Memory

- Implement smooth scrolling
- Implement a way to speed the guy up
- Make `TileRelX` and `TileRelY` relative to center of tile
- Create `handmade_tile.h` and `handmade_tile.cpp`
- Rename `tile_map` to `tile_chunk` and extract everything from `world` to `tile_map`, now tilemap means the whole map
- Define `memory_arena` and `PushSize`, `PushArray` and create tile chunks programmatically

### Day 35: Basic Sparse Tilemap Storage

- Make tile size small so we can see more chunks
- Remove `TileSizeInPixels` and `MetersToPixels` from `tile_map`
- Use random.org to generate some random numbers and use them to generate screen randomly
- Generate doors based on our choice
- Allocate space for tiles only when we access
- Add Z index to tilemap

### Day 36: Loading BMPs

- FUN: Windows can't render BMPs correct. This is very amusing, because they are the guys who invented BMP.
- Make player go up and down. I already implemented this function in the previous day, but I need to reimplement it in a new way: when the player moves to the stair, it goes automatically, no need to push any button.
- Rename `TileRelX` and `TileRelY` to `OffsetX` and `OffsetY`
- Define `bitmap_header` and parse bitmap. We have to use `#pragma pack(push, 1) and #pragma pack(pop)` to make vs pack our struct correctly

### Day 37: Basic Bitmap Rendering

- Design a very specific BMP to help debug our rendering. This is a very clever method.
- I find that my structured_art.bmp has different byte order from casey's. It turns out that BMP has something called RedMask, GreenMask, BlueMask and AlphaMask.
- BMP byte order: should determined by masks
- Render background bmp
- Define `loaded_bitmap` to pack all things up
- Define `DrawBitmap`

- RESOURCE
  - [Linear-Space Lighting (i.e. Gamma)](http://wiki.polycount.com/w/images/0/0e/John_Hable_-_Linear-Space_Lighting_%28i.e._Gamma%29.pdf)
  - [Lighting Shading by John Hable](https://www.slideshare.net/naughty_dog/lighting-shading-by-john-hable)
- Use `pow(2.2)` and `sqrt(2.2)` to convert between sRGB and linear space
  - `pow(2.2)` is just a good approximation, is **not** suitable for all monitors
  - We use `pow(2)` to approximate `pow(2.2)` because it's much more cheaper
- Implement `SRGB255ToLinear1` and `Linear1ToSRGB255`
- Implement a simple color tint

### Day 101: The Inverse and the Transpose

This is a math day. Casey explains matrices and other stuff of linear algebra.

Speaking abuot lingear algebra, I highly recommond this book [Linear Algebra by Jim Hefferon](https://hefferon.net/linearalgebra/). It's freely available and totally accessible.

Inverse of a rotation matrix:

```
X and Y are perpendicular unit vectors.

R =
Xx Yx
Xy Yy

R inverse = R' =
Xx Xy
Yx Yy

Based on this fact:

XxXx +XyXy = Inner(X, X) = 1

XxYx + XyYy = Inner(X, Y) = 0

YxXx + YyXy = Inner(X, Y) = 0

YxYx + YyYy = Inner(Y, Y) = 1

So R' R =

1 0
0 1
```

### Day 102: Transforming Normals Properly

Because normals are perpendicular to vectors, they are affected in a perpendicular way by any transforms we do.

- Rotate the normal
- Document `SampleEnvironmentMap` function
- Paint the LOD to debug SampleEnvironmentMap

### Day 103: Card-like Normal Map Reflections

In a 2D perspective, things are intentionally wrong, because the art wants them to be different.

### Day 109: Resolution-Independent Rendering

- Change `align` to `alignPercentage`
- Add `widthOverHeight` to loaded_bitmap
- Remove `metersToPixels` in game_state
- `PushBitmap` should take a `height` param

- Basic process of making things run quickly
  - Gather statistics
    - where it is slow
    - what are their characteristics
