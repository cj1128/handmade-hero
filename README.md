## Intro

- This is my personal study notes of [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org).
- If you think **writing a professional-quality game from scratch on your own (no engine no library)** is interesting and challenging, I highly recommend this project. In my opinion, it's the best I can find.
- Deepest thanks to *Casey Muratori* for this excellent project. It's really helpful.

## Roadmap

### Day 1

- Install Visual Studio 2019
- Call `vsdevcmd` to init command line tools
- Use `cl` to build our program
- Use `devenv` to start visual studio to debug, e.g. `devenv w:\build\win32_handmade.exe`
